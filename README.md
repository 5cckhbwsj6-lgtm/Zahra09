Hey there! 👋

I’m Zahra, a Process Automation Engineering student based in Azerbaijan.
I love working with data, exploring automation systems, and building smarter digital solutions.
If I get a new idea, chances are I’ll test it, analyze it, and try to turn it into something useful.
My main technical stack includes R, SQL (PostgreSQL & OracleSQL), Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and tools for automation and smart technologies.
I enjoy cleaning data, visualizing insights, and understanding how systems work behind the scenes.
I’ve completed several analytics projects through intensive training programs, and I’ve also gained hands-on experience as an Automation Engineer Intern, working with PLCs, SCADA systems, and smart home technologies.
If you want to see what I’m working on, check out my pinned projects — I’m always improving something new.
